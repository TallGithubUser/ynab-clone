# In which I learn Ruby On Rails and Ember.js 
Hi, there! I'm TallGithubUser. One day I'd love to work at You Need A Budget (YNAB). I reached out to a recruiter, she said I should learn Ruby On Rails and Ember.js. So here I am. I'm just a software developer, standing in front of a company, asking them to hire me. I have the experience, but just don't know the language. What better way to learn than to try to replicate what the kind folks over at YNAB have created?  

I also thought it'd be fun to capture the whole learning experience from the `git init` all the way up to `rails server`. Hope you enjoy hopping along for the ride! Maybe you'll learn something along the way, too.  

Of course, nothing beats the original application. Check them out [here](www.ynab.com).

From one developer to another,
